Description: 'Granger causality test of individual FRM@Americas candidates and individual commonly used systemic risk measures. VIX, Google Trends (GT) of the keyword ''financial crisis'', 
FT (Financial turbulence index) and SRISK (Systemic Risk Index) for Americas are taken as comparable measures. 
The Granger Causality test is conducted based on the procedure proposed by the paper ''FRM: a Financial Risk Meter based on penalizing tail event occcurrence from 
Yu,L., W. K. HÃ¤rdle, L.Borke, and T. Benschop''. For two non-integrated and non-stationary time-series, the transformed time series are applied to VAR model.'
 
Keywords: 'FRM, Granger causality test, VIX, Google trends, Financial turbulence, SRISK.'
