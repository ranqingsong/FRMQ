Published in: 'Distribution of probabilities of Financial Risk Meter (FRM)'
  
Description: 'compare preformances of all FRM@Americas and FRM@Europe candidates 
including standard FRM calculated with average penalization parameters and novel FRM proposed with quantiles at 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% and interquartile range (IQR) 
during recession and expansion period. Data during financial crisis of 2007 and COVID-19 pandemic are employed.'
