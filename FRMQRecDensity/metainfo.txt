Published in: 'Distribution of probabilities of Financial Risk Meter (FRM)'
  
Description: 'compare performances of all FRM@Americas and FRM@Europe candidates 
including standard FRM calculated with average penalization parameters and novel FRM proposed with quantiles at 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% and interquartile range (IQR) during recession and expansion periods. Empirical data during financial crisis of 2007 and COVID-19 pandemic are collected.'
 
Keywords: 'FRM, penalization parameter, expansion, recession, kernel density estimation'
