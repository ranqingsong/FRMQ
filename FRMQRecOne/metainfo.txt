Description: 'Use probit and logistic regression models constructed with one FRM candidate lagged at x month (x ranges from 1 to 6) to predict the probability of observing a recession. 
Models are constructed and compared for seven FRM candidates for Americas and Europe respectively. Models for each FRM candidates are compared with AIC, BIC, and Estrella Pseudo R-sqaure that is commonly used for recession prediction issue. 
Implied recession probabilities of models with siginicant predictor are plotted.'
 
Keywords: 'FRM, expansion, recession, probit regression, logistic regression, static recession prediction model, Estrella Pseudo R-square, oneperiod'

Example:
- 1: 'implied recession probabilities for seven FRM@Americas candidates, which are estimated from the uniperiod probit regression model with individual FRM candidates lagged at 1 month'
- 2: 'implied recession probabilities for seven FRM@Americas candidates, which are estimated from the uniperiod logistic regression model with individual FRM candidates lagged at 1 month'
- 3: 'implied recession probabilities for seven FRM@Europe candidates, which are estimated from the uniperiod probit regression model with individual FRM candidates lagged at 1 month'
- 4: 'implied recession probabilities for seven FRM@Europe candidates, which are estimated from the uniperiod logistic regression model with individual FRM candidates lagged at 1 month'
- 5: 'implied recession probabilities for seven FRM@Americas candidates, which are estimated from the uniperiod probit regression model with individual FRM candidates lagged at 2, 3, or 4 months'
- 6: 'implied recession probabilities for seven FRM@Europe candidates, which are estimated from the uniperiod probit regression model with individual FRM candidates lagged at 2 or 3 months'
- 7: 'converts values of individual FRM@Americas candidates obtained last month to the probability of observing recession at current month'
- 8: 'converts values of individual FRM@Europe candidates obtained last month to the probability of observing recession at current month'
