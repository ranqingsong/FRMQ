Published in: 'Distribution of probabilities of Financial Risk Meter (FRM)'
  
Description: 'Use probit and logistic regression models constructed with one FRM candidates lagged at x month (x ranges from 1 to 6) to predict the probability of observing a recession. 
Models are constructed and compared for seven FRM candidates for Americas and Europe respectively. Models for each FRM candidates are compared with AIC, BIC, Estrella Pseudo R-sqaure which is commonly used for recession prediction. 
Predicted recession probabilities of models with siginicant predictor will be plotted.'
 
Keywords: 'FRM, penalisation parameter, expansion, recession, probit regression, logistic regression, static recession prediction model, Estrella Pseudo R-square, oneperiod'

Example:
- 1: 'implied recession probabilities for seven FRM@Americas candidates, which are estimated from the oneperiod probit regression model with FRM candidates lagged at 1 month'
- 2: 'implied recession probabilities for seven FRM@Americas candidates, which are estimated from the oneperiod logistic regression model with FRM candidates lagged at 1 month'
- 3: 'implied recession probabilities for seven FRM@Europe candidates, which are estimated from the oneperiod probit regression model with FRM candidates lagged at 1 month'
- 4: 'implied recession probabilities for seven FRM@Europe candidates, which are estimated from the oneperiod logistic regression model with FRM candidates lagged at 1 month'
- 5: 'implied recession probabilities for seven FRM@Americas candidates, which are estimated from the oneperiod probit regression model with the FRM candidates lagged at 2, 3, or 4 months'
- 6: 'implied recession probabilities for seven FRM@Europe candidates, which are estimated from the oneperiod probit regression model with the FRM candidates lagged at 2 or 3 months'
