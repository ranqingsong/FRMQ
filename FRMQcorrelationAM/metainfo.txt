Name of Quantlet: 'FRMQcorrelationAM'
 
Published in: 'Distribution of probabilities of Financial Risk Meter (FRM)'
  
Description: 'Correlation test and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test of individual FRM@Americas candidates and individual commonly used systemic risk measures. VIX, Google Trends (GT) of the keyword ''financial crisis'', 
FT (Financial turbulence index) and SRISK (Systemic Risk Index) for Americas are taken as comparable measures. High correlation coefficient and lower KS test statistics reveal the comovement of FRM candidates and other systemic risk measures.'
 
Keywords: 'FRM, Correlation test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov(KS), VIX, Google trends, Financial turbulence, SRISK'
