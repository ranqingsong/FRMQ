Published in: 'Distribution of probabilities of Financial Risk Meter (FRM)'
  
Description: 'Correlation test and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test of individual FRM@Europe candidates and individual commonly used systemic risk measures. VSTOXX, CISS and
FT (Financial turbulence index) for Europe are taken as comparable measures. High correlation coefficient and lower KS test statistics reveal the comovement of FRM 
candidates and other systemic risk measures.'
 
Keywords: 'FRM, Correlation test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov(KS), VSTOXX, CISS, Financial turbulence'
