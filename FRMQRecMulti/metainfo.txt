Description: 'Use probit regression models constructed with one type of FRM candidates lagged from 1 to 6 months to predict the probability of observing a recession. Models are constructed and compared for seven FRM candidates for Americas and Europe sequentially. For each FRM candidate, the optimal model is stepwisely selected according to the AIC value. As alternatives, models composed of individual FRM candidates lagged at 1 and 2 months, as well as models of FRM lagged at 1, 2 and 3 months are analysed.'
 
Keywords: 'FRM, penalisation parameter, expansion, recession, kernel density estimation'

- 2: 'implied recession probabilities for seven FRM@Americas candidates, which are estimated from the multiperiod probit regression model with individual FRM candidates lagged at 1 and 2 months'
- 3: 'implied recession probabilities for seven FRM@Americas candidates, which are estimated from the multiperiod probit regression model with individual FRM candidates lagged at 1,2 and 3 months'
- 4: 'implied recession probabilities for seven FRM@Europe candidates, which are estimated from the multiperiod probit regression model with the lowest AIC value for each FRM candidate'
- 5: 'implied recession probabilities for seven FRM@Europe candidates, which are estimated from the multiperiod probit regression model with respective FRM candidates lagged at 1 and 2 months'
