Description: 'Use probit regression models constructed with one FRM candidates lagged from 1 to 6 months to predict the probability of observing a recession. 
Models are constructed and compared for seven FRM candidates for Americas and Europe respectively. The optimal model is stepwisely selected according to AIC value. 
Models composed of FRM lagged at 1 and 2 months, as well as that of FRM lagged at 1, 2 and months are analysed.'
 
Keywords: 'FRM, penalisation parameter, expansion, recession, kernel density estimation'

Example:
- 1: 'implied recession probabilities for seven FRM@Americas candidates, which are estimated from the multiperiod probit regression model with the lowest AIC value'
- 2: 'implied recession probabilities for seven FRM@Americas candidates, which are estimated from the multiperiod probit regression model with the FRM candidates lagged at 1 and 2 months'
- 3: 'implied recession probabilities for seven FRM@Americas candidates, which are estimated from the multiperiod probit regression model with the FRM candidates lagged at 1,2 and 3 months'
- 4: 'implied recession probabilities for seven FRM@Europe candidates, which are estimated from the multiperiod probit regression model with the lowest AIC value'
- 5: 'implied recession probabilities for seven FRM@Europe candidates, which are estimated from the multiperiod probit regression model with the FRM candidates lagged at 1 and 2 months'
- 6: 'implied recession probabilities for seven FRM@Europe candidates, which are estimated from the multiperiod probit regression model with the FRM candidates lagged at 1,2 and 3 months'
- 7: 'out-of-sample validation of the optimal multiperiod regression models for standard FRM@Americas'
